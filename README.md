# Privacy packing project

This repo contains code to simulate and evaluate different privacy packing policies, in different settings (offline/online, multi-block/single-block). We use RÃ©nyi DP only (not epsilon-delta DP).

## Organization

-  See [privacypacking/](privacypacking/) for some documentation about the code
-  Let's try to add some tests in [tests/](tests/)
-  [notebooks/](notebooks/) for the Jupyter notebooks (that can import the code with `import privacypacking` when the virtual environment is activated)

## Contributing

- Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to set up the environment. The `poetry.lock` will ensure that we all have the exact same packages. Useful commands:
    + `poetry add plotly` to install a package (e.g. Plotly) and update the requirements
    + `poetry update` to update the dependencies, `poetry lock --no-update` to just refresh the lockfile
    + `poetry install` to install the dependencies
    + `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment

- Code style: flake8, Black, Google-style docstrings (ideally)
